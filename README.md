# PapIHM

An awesome application to remind you what to do !

## Steps to run the project
```
git clone git@github.com:GODOmegaPi/PapIHM.git
cd PapIHM/webapp
npm install
npm run serve
```

If you have an issue with the `npm run serve` step, use the following commands to start the project (in the forlder `PapIHM/webapp`)
```
npm i -g eslint
eslint --fix .
npm run serve
```

You should now see, inside your terminal, the URL usable to interact with our app !
